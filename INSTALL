Requirements
------------

Common:

- gcc

Windows:

- MinGW

For the matlab client 'mex' is required as well.

Build
-----

The user can choose to eithe build the full project (Linux only) or to build a
smaller client library with MATLAB bindings (Linux or Windows+MinGW). 

If the source code was checked out from the repository bootstrap by first calling

	autoreconf	

To build the full project:

	./Setup.lhs configure
	make

The configure step will warn of any missing dependencies, which have to be
installed using the systems package manager or manually from hackage. See
nemo.cabal for configuration options. These can be set by doing
 
	./Setup.lhs configure -fprofile -fexamples

to enable profiling and also compile the standalone example programs.

CUDA support is enabled if the configure script can locate the installation
directory. A warning is issued if it is not found. A specific location for the
CUDA installation directory can be specified by passing configuration options
to the configure script

	./Setup.lhs configure --configure-option=--with-cuda=<cuda-install-path>

or can be explicitly disabled with

	./Setup.lhs configure --configure-option=--without-cuda

To build the client library:

	./Setup.lhs configure -fclient
	./Setup.lhs build

Installing haskell packages from hackage
----------------------------------------

All packages follow the same Cabal-based installation procedure:

- Download and unpack
- runhaskell Setup.[l]hs configure
- runhaskell Setup.[l]hs build
- runhaskell Setup.[l]hs install

This process can be simplified by installing and using the cabal-install
program. See the online cabal documentation for more details.
