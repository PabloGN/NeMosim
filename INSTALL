Requirements
------------

Common:

- ghc 6.8
- gcc

Windows:

- MinGW

For the matlab client 'mex' is required as well.

Build
-----

The user can choose to eithe build the full project (Linux only) or to build a
smaller client library with MATLAB bindings (Linux or Windows+MinGW). 

To build the full project:

	./Setup.lhs configure
	./Setup.lhs build

The configure step will warn of any missing dependencies, which have to be
installed using the systems package manager or manually from hackage. See
nemo.cabal for configuration options. These can be set by doing
 
	./Setup.lhs configure --flags="profile -cuda"

To enable profiling and disable cuda, or

	./Setup.lhs configure -fprofile -fexamples

To enable profiling and also compile the standalone example programs.

CUDA support is not stritly required, but is enabled by default. Since there is
currently no autotools or similar configuration step, you may have to disable this manually.

To build the client library:

	./Setup.lhs configure -fclient
	./Setup.lhs build

Known problems
--------------

- On Windows ghc 6.10 fails to correctly build dlls. Solution: use 6.8 instead.
- The client Matlab library fails to build on 64-bit linux.

Installing haskell packages from hackage
----------------------------------------

All packages follow the same Cabal-based installation procedure:

- Download and unpack
- runhaskell Setup.[l]hs configure
- runhaskell Setup.[l]hs build
- runhaskell Setup.[l]hs install

See cabal documentation for more details.
