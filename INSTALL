Requirements
------------

Common:

- ghc 6.8
- gcc

Windows:

- MinGW

For the matlab client 'mex' is required as well.

Build
-----

The user can choose to eithe build the full project (Linux only) or to build a
smaller client library with MATLAB bindings (Linux or Windows+MinGW). 

To build the full project:

	./Setup.lhs configure
	./Setup.lhs build

The configure step will warn of any missing dependencies, which have to be
installed using the systems package manager or manually from hackage.

To build the client library:

	./Setup.lhs configure -fclient
	./Setup.lhs build

Known problems
--------------

On Windows ghc 6.10 fails to correctly build dlls. Solution: use 6.8 instead.

Installing haskell packages from hackage
----------------------------------------

All packages follow the same Cabal-based installation procedure:

- Download and unpack
- runhaskell Setup.[l]hs configure
- runhaskell Setup.[l]hs build
- runhaskell Setup.[l]hs install

See cabal documentation for more details.
