=============
Low-level API
=============

The Nemo core is written in haskell, but exposes a c api, which could be used
by other interfaces such as MatlabAPI and PythonAPI. Currently this interface
is only exposed to a simple client, which has to connect to a separate server.
The interface is specified in Network.ClientFFI.

An external program can call this interface through tree functions:

1. Set up network and start simulation
2. Step through network
3. Close simulation

On the haskell side of the FFI, the network is constructed using nemo's internal format, and then serialised and sent over the network to the server. This means that the haskell runtime system (RTS) needs to be invoked before the low-level API can be used. See MatlabAPI for a working example.

The CUDA backend also exposes a C API, but this is quite strongly coupled with the nemo core, as some mapping etc. takes place on the haskell side.
