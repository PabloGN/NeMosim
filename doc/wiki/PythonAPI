Python API

This is not implemented.

The python API should provide all the functionality of the LowLevelAPI, and
should additionally provide some means of visualisation. For the visualisation
matplotlib would be perfect, other than the fact that it's a bit slow.
matplotlib can create high-quality plots which can be written to file or can be
used in many GUI toolkits, including Qt (which itself has python bindings).
