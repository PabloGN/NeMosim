Nemo v0.3.4 - Matlab API
========================

The MATLAB API can be used to control a simulation running on a dedicated host.
The network is constructed in MATLAB, and is then transferred to the host. The
MATLAB client can provide stimulus to the running simulation and read back
firing data.


Installation
============

Windows: Unpack the zip file somewhere sensible. The pre-compiled binaries
should just work.

Usage
=====

Ensure that the directory containing the MEX files and library files are in
both the MATLAB path and in the system library path. The MATLAB path can be
set either in the GUI or in the terminal::

	addpath <install-dir>;

The network is generated on the client side. The user should generate n-vectors
``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ``d``, ``u``, and ``v`` that describes the neuron
population. The connectivity is described using n-by-m matrices specifying the
postsynaptic neuron indices, synaptic weights, and delays.

A simple script which connects to a server, runs for 60 s with just a single
firing stimulus, processing the returned firing data with the function ``foo``,
could be written as follows::
    
    . . . code that generates the network
     
    nemoConnect('axel01.doc.ic.ac.uk');
    nemoStart(a, b, c, d, u, v, targets, delays, weights);
    for i=1:60
        fired = nemoRun(1000, [500 1]);
        foo(fired);
    end
    nemoTerminate;

or simpler, if 60 seconds worth of data can be processed (and buffered) at once::
    
    . . . code that generates the network

    nemoConnect('axel01.doc.ic.ac.uk');
    nemoStart(a, b, c, d, u, v, targets, delays, weights);
    fired = nemoRun(60000, [500 1], 4, 30);
    foo(fired);
    nemoTerminate;

To run for 1000ms applying STDP every 50ms, do something like the following::

    . . . code that generates the network

    prefire = 1.0 * exp(-(1:20)./20)
    postfire = 0.8 * exp(-(1:20)./20)
    nemoConnect('axel01.doc.ic.ac.uk');
    nemoEnableStdp(prefire, postfire, 30.0)
    nemoSetNetwork(a, b, c, d, u, v, targets, delays, weights);
    fired = nemoRun(50, [1 1]);
    for i=50:50:1000
        nemoApplyStdp(1.0);
        fired = nemoRun(50, []);
        foo(fired);
    end
    nemoTerminate;

The vectors ``prefire`` and ``postfire`` specify the STDP function in the prefire and postfire parts of the STDP window. The length of these vectors specify the size of the STDP window.

.. For small networks (a few thousands of neurons), it might be interesting to run
.. a number of networks in parallel, as otherwise the simulation backend will be
.. severely underutilized. This can be done simply by generating a number of
.. networks, and then simply concatenating them into a single large disjoint network::
	
..	handle = nsStart('axel01.doc.ic.ac.uk', 
..		[a1, a2, a3, a4], 
..		[b1, b2, b3, b4], 
..		[c1, c2, c3, c4], 
..		[d1, d2, d3, d4], 
..		[u1, u2, u3, u4], 
..		[v1, v2, v3, v4], 
..		[p1, p2, p3, p4], 
..		[d1, d2, d3, d4], 
..		[w1, w2, w3, w4]);
..	fstim = [500 1]
..	fired = nsRunPar(handle, 1000, repmat(fstim, 1, 4))
..	foo(fired);
..	nsTerminate(handle);

.. A parallel version of nsRun handles the input and output, but needs to be told
.. the size of each network. A 1s simulation of four networks might look like this::


.. Using this method, the user has to separate the firing data into the separate
.. networks. An alternative pair of functions, ``nsStartPar`` and ``nsRunPar``,
.. will be available shortly, which will do this for the user.

.. On the current backend (a single Tesla C1060), anything less than 16k neurons is
.. guaranteed to leave hardware unused. 16k neurons should *use* all hardware, but
.. will stil underutilise it. Between 50k and 100k neurons seems a reasonable size
.. to aim for, but there's currently no hard data regarding what size network
.. results in the greatest throughput.


Function reference
==================

The reference for each function is also available from within MATLAB by using
the usual ``help`` function. 

.. The function reference is generated from help-text for m-files
.. include:: functionReference

Troubleshooting
===============

Calling MEX function results in warning regarding compiler version 
------------------------------------------------------------------

This problem is described in some detail here: 
http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/data/1-2H64MF.html.
One workaround mentioned there is to set the LD_PRELOAD environment variable
before starting MATLAB. For bash::

	export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libgcc_s.so.1

For csh::

	setenv LD_PRELOAD /lib/libgcc_s.so.1

Matlab fails with ``Invalid MEX-file``  ``libnemoclient.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check that the directory containing the library files are in the system library
path. E.g. using bash::

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/nemo
