When using both L1 and L0 firing, L0 is handled at the beginning of the kernel (using fan-in) and L1 is handled at the end of the kernel (using fan-out). In both cases we need to compute a table of explicit firing indices. We should check whether it's faster to store and load this, or just to recompute as is done currently.
