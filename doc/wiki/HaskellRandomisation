The regression tests regularily fails as we move development between machines.
There are a few possible reasons for this. One is that the RNG differs between
the machines (we already make sure we use the same seed). Another possibility is
that the difference is due to differences in rounding and execution order in the
floating point computations on different machines. This is something we'll have
to deal with at some point in any event.

Todo:

- check if randomisation differes between machines
- check out possibilities for rolling own RNG
