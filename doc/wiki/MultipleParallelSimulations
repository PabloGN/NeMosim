Multiple parallel simulations

This can be done by providing nsStartM and nsSyncM which deals with multiple
networks. On the host side these would be seen as a single network, albeit a
disjoint one. The handle returned from nsStartM should contain both the socket
and a description of the size of each network. nsSyncM can then split up the
firing into several matrices.
