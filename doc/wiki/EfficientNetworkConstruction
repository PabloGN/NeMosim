Efficient network construction
==============================

The current method for creating networks is wholly inadequate. It seems, for
example, that when constructing a fully connected network, the topology is
flattened for *every single* synapse. 

We need to modify the underlying data structures and the connection methods. 

For neuron storage it might be an idea to use blocks of random-access-memory,
perhaps joined in a map at a higher level.
