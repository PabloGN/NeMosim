nemoSetBackend: specify where/how the simulation will run
---------------------------------------------------------

::

	nemoSetBackend(HOSTNAME)

Currently only a remote backend is supported, i.e. the simulation takes place on a remote machine, to which the nemo process communicates. Future versions will support running with different backends on the local machine.
