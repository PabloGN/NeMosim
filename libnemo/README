Build/installation
------------------

The build process uses cmake. Basic usage on UNIX:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
su
make install

Dependencies
------------

- CUDA toolkit >= 2.1 (SDK not required)
- Boost (smart pointers, tuples, and random number generation)

Note that the CUDA compiler driver 'nvcc' is not compatible with all versions
of gcc, especially newer versions of gcc.

Usage
-----

The 'examples' directory contains an example network using the C++ API.

On UNIX, the build process generates man pages. Check 'man 3 nemo' for an
overview of the library, 'man 3 nemo-c' for C API reference and 'man 3
nemo-cpp' for the C++ API reference.
